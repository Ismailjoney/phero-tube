                Discuss the scope of var, let, and const..?
            </div>
            <div class="collapse-content">
                <p>In JavaScript, the scope of variables declared with var, let, and const differs in terms of their
                    visibility and lifetime within the program. Here's a brief overview of each:

                    var:

                    Variables declared with var have function scope, meaning they are accessible throughout the function
                    in which they are declared.
                    If declared outside of any function, var variables have global scope, making them accessible
                    throughout the entire script.
                    They are subject to hoisting, which means that the variable declaration is moved to the top of its
                    containing function or global scope during the compilation phase, while the assignment remains in
                    place. This can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior.
                    Example:
                    javascript
                    Copy code
                    function example() {
                    var x = 10;
                    if (true) {
                    var y = 20;
                    }
                    console.log(x); // Output: 10
                    console.log(y); // Output: 20 (due to hoisting)
                    }
                    example();
                    console.log(x); // Error: x is not defined (outside the function scope)
                    console.log(y); // Output: 20 (global scope)
                    let:

                    Variables declared with let have block scope, meaning they are accessible only within the block in
                    which they are declared (a block is typically defined by curly braces {}).
                    They are not hoisted, which means that they are not accessible before the line they are declared on.
                    let allows for better control over variable scoping and helps prevent certain types of bugs, such as
                    accidental variable redeclarations within the same block.
                    Example:
                    javascript
                    Copy code
                    function example() {
                    let x = 10;
                    if (true) {
                    let y = 20;
                    console.log(x); // Output: 10
                    console.log(y); // Output: 20
                    }
                    console.log(x); // Output: 10
                    console.log(y); // Error: y is not defined (outside the block scope)
                    }
                    example();
                    const:

                    Constants declared with const also have block scope, similar to let.
                    However, they must be initialized with a value upon declaration, and their value cannot be changed
                    or reassigned once initialized. This makes them immutable.
                    Like let, const variables are not hoisted and are only accessible within the block in which they are
                    defined.
                    Example:
                    javascript
                    Copy code
                    function example() {
                    const x = 10;
                    if (true) {
                    const y = 20;
                    console.log(x); // Output: 10
                    console.log(y); // Output: 20
                    }
                    console.log(x); // Output: 10
                    console.log(y); // Error: y is not defined (outside the block scope)
                    }
                    example();
                    In general, it's recommended to use let and const over var due to their more predictable behavior
                    and better scoping rules. Use const for values that should not change, and let for variables that
                    might be reassigned.

                Tell us the use cases of null and undefined..?
            </div>
            <div class="collapse-content">
                <p>The concepts of null and undefined are used in programming languages, including JavaScript, to
                    represent the absence of a meaningful value. While they might seem similar, they have distinct use
                    cases:

                    null:

                    null is a primitive value in JavaScript that represents the intentional absence of any object value.
                    It's often used as a placeholder to indicate that a variable or object property does not currently
                    have a value, but it is expected to have one at some point.
                    Developers might explicitly set a variable or property to null to indicate that it has no value or
                    to reset it to a neutral state.
                    Example use cases:
                    Initializing variables that are expected to hold objects but don't yet have a meaningful value.
                    Indicating that a function parameter is optional and not required to have a value.
                    Explicitly clearing out the value of a variable or property.
                    undefined:

                    undefined is a primitive value in JavaScript that indicates that a variable has been declared but
                    has not been assigned a value.
                    It's automatically assigned to variables that have been declared but not initialized, or to object
                    properties that do not exist.
                    Unlike null, which is explicitly set, undefined usually occurs implicitly when a value is not
                    provided or assigned.
                    Example use cases:
                    Variables that have been declared but not yet assigned a value.
                    Object properties that have not been defined or do not exist.
                    Return value of functions that do not explicitly return anything (by default, JavaScript functions
                    return undefined).
                    In summary, null is used to represent the intentional absence of a value, while undefined typically
                    indicates an uninitialized or non-existent value. Understanding the distinction between them is
                    important for writing clean and predictable code.

                What do you mean by REST API..?
            </div>
            <div class="collapse-content">
                <p>REST API stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface. It is an
                    architectural style for designing networked applications. RESTful APIs are based on the principles
                    of REST, which include:

                    Stateless communication: Each request from a client to the server must contain all the necessary
                    information for the server to understand and fulfill the request. The server doesn't store any
                    client state between requests.

                    Client-server architecture: The client and server are separate and independent, allowing them to
                    evolve separately. This enhances scalability and simplifies component implementation.

                    Uniform interface: RESTful APIs expose resources as unique URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) and
                    use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform actions on those resources.
                    Additionally, they often utilize standard media types such as JSON or XML for data representation.

                    Cacheability: Responses from a server can be marked as cacheable or non-cacheable, allowing clients
                    to reuse responses and improve performance.

                    Layered system: A client interacts with the RESTful API without knowing whether it is connected
                    directly to the server or through an intermediary (such as a proxy), enhancing flexibility and
                    scalability.

                    RESTful APIs are widely used for building web services due to their simplicity, scalability, and
                    compatibility with HTTP, which is the protocol of the web. They are commonly used in client-server
                    communication for web and mobile applications, allowing different software systems to interact with
                    each other over a network.</p>
